# BGE Rules 

# How to update the rules:

- Edit the `rules.json` file with the new rules. 
    - Rules will be pulled from the first `embed` in the `embeds` array.
    - description, color, title, footer, and thumbnail url can be modified.
- Push changes to the repository and the bot will automatically update the rules in Discord.

# Troubleshooting:
- If the bot does not update the rules, check the logs for any errors.
