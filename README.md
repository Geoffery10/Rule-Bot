# Viewing the Rules:
- The rules can be viewed in the `#rules⚖️` Discord channel or in code [here](https://github.com/Geoffery10/Rule-Bot/blob/main/rules.yml).

# How to update the rules:

- Edit the `rules.yml` file with the new rules. 
    - Rules will be pulled from the first `embed` in the `embeds` array.
    - description, color, title, footer, and thumbnail url can be modified.
- Push changes to the repository and the bot will automatically update the rules in Discord.
- If you are not the owner of the repository, you can create a pull request with your changes.

# Troubleshooting:
- If the bot does not update the rules, check the logs for any errors.
